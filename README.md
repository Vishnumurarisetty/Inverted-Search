# Inverted-Search
The Inverted Search project is a powerful tool for efficient data retrieval. It builds an inverted index to allow quick searches within a dataset by linking each term to its occurrence, which is essential in search engines and large databases.
**Key Features:**

**Inverted Index Creation:** Maps unique words to their occurrences within the dataset, allowing quick and precise searches.
Efficient Storage: Stores data efficiently to minimize memory usage, making it suitable for large datasets.
Optimized Search Algorithm: Implements optimized search algorithms for faster query responses.
User-Friendly CLI: Offers a simple command-line interface for easy use and seamless interaction with the index.
Technical Highlights:

**Languages Used:** C language for efficient memory management and quick processing.
Data Structures: Uses linked lists and hash tables for storing and retrieving data effectively.
Error Handling: Ensures stability with robust error handling for various input cases.
Memory Management: Implements dynamic memory allocation for flexible storage.
Use Cases:

**Text Analysis:** Suitable for applications that need to analyze and search through large text files or logs.
Database Systems: Can be adapted for use in database indexing for quick data retrieval.
How to Use:

Compile the code using the provided Makefile.
Run the executable and input the dataset file for indexing.
Use search commands to retrieve data linked to specific terms.
Project Structure:

src/ - Contains the main program and module files.
include/ - Header files with function declarations.
data/ - Sample datasets for testing the index.
README.md - Complete instructions and examples.
Future Enhancements:

Adding support for complex search queries.
Optimizing memory management for larger datasets.
